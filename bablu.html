<p><b>Ramanujan</b> initially developed his own <small>mathematical research in isolation</small>. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Eysenck">Hans Eysenck</a>, "he tried to interest the leading <del>professional mathematicians</del> in his work, but <i>failed for the most part</i>. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered".[4] Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 <small>he began a postal correspondence</small> with the <mark>English mathematician G. H. Hardy</mark> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, England. Recognising Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to travel to <u>Cambridge</u>. In his notes, Hardy commented that Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that "defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before",[5] and some recently proven but highly advanced results.a<sup>3</sup>+b<sup>3</sup> and h<sub>2</sub>so<sub>4</sub>
